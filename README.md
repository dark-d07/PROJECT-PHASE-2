MEDI-AI 🧠💊

MEDI-AI is an intelligent medical assistance system designed to combine machine learning, computer vision, and NLP to help analyze images, classify medical data, and retrieve relevant medical information.


## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Capture and analyze body images (e.g., detect facial regions using Raspberry Pi camera).
- 🧠 Train and evaluate medical image classification models using TensorFlow.
- 🔍 Search and summarize medical content from trusted online sources using NLP.
- 📊 Evaluate classification performance using sklearn metrics and visualization.
- 🔐 Secure remote operations using SSH (`paramiko`).
- ☁️ Firebase integration for cloud storage and data sync.
